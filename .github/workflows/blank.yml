# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Get changed files
        id: changed-files
        uses: jitterbit/get-changed-files@v1

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: loop files
        run: |
         mapfile -d ',' -t added_modified_files < <(printf '%s,' '${{ steps.files.outputs.added_modified }}')
         for added_modified_file in "${added_modified_files[@]}"; do
